## Abstract

ApexHub is the best place where you can watch Formula 1 for free. We have streams always on Live and a Schedule for you to never miss the next race on the calender. Plus, you can enjoy our reaction Mini-Game when you need a break from the action.

It includes:

Reaction Mini-Game


## More Info:

This is a website dedicated to Formula 1 fans. It provides an interface that utilizes a public API to retrieve information about the next race and a redirection link with a frame for accessing streams of content of live races. Please note that this site is strictly for educational purposes and I do not encourage the use of it for piracy.

The implementation of the mini-game was based on a simple idea presented by @jakearchibald, as seen in the video: https://youtu.be/BhLr43elNCE?t=508. Credits to @jakearchibald for the inspiration and careful execution of this concept.

Please be aware that this website does not support or encourage any piracy activities. It is intended solely to enhance knowledge and interest in Formula 1 in an educational manner.
